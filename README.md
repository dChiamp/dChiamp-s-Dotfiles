#MY dotfiles inspired by Paul Irish

simple, small 

great functions and aliases

##you should

-create your own .extra file to set your $PATH

-look through everything and make sure it works for you
..*especially in aliases, look for the ls mod that might break you


##custom bootstrap, run at your own risk!

-add the dot files you want at the top to make symlinks

-if anything goes wrong, delete dotfiles repo to break symlinks:
..*rm -f ~/dotfiles

##consider
-install rupa z from github

-upgrade to bash 4
